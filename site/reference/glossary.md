# Glossary

**Agent** — a Markdown file defining a specialized role for Claude Code. Shipped as part of a team. Lives in `agents/` in a team repo; copied into `.claude/agents/` in a project.

**atl** — the CLI (`atl install`, `atl list`, …). Installs teams into a project. Go binary.

**Cache** — the shared on-disk directory where `atl` stores cloned team repos. One per machine: `~/.claude/repos/agentteamland/`. Projects copy into it.

**Children pattern** — a convention for complex agents: top-level `agent.md` stays short (identity, scope, principles, Knowledge Base); detailed knowledge lives as topic-per-file under `children/`. Each child file carries a `knowledge-base-summary` frontmatter field that `/save-learnings` uses to auto-rebuild the parent agent.md's Knowledge Base section. Mirrored in skills as `learnings/` (auto-rebuilds the skill.md's Accumulated Learnings section).

**Circular chain** — when a team's `extends` chain loops back on itself (`A → B → A`). Detected at install time; the CLI fails with the full chain printed.

**Dependencies** — additional teams a team requires, specified via the `dependencies` field in `team.json`. Resolved and installed at the same time as the team itself.

**`excludes`** — list in `team.json` of parent-provided agent/skill/rule names that the child does **not** want copied. Takes effect after the parent is installed.

**`extends`** — single-parent inheritance. A team with `extends: "parent@^1.0.0"` installs the parent first and layers its own content on top.

**Override** — when a child team ships an item with the same name as a parent's item, the child's version wins. Full replace, no merging.

**Project** — a directory you run `atl` in. Gets a `.claude/` subdirectory populated with copies to installed teams.

**Registry** — the public catalog of teams. A single `teams.json` file at [`agentteamland/registry`](https://github.com/agentteamland/registry). PR-driven, schema-validated.

**Rule** — a Markdown file that's always loaded by Claude Code (unlike skills, which must be invoked). Shipped as part of a team in `rules/`; copied into `.claude/rules/`.

**Scaffolder** — team-scoped skill named `/create-new-project` that bootstraps a new project on the team's stack. Must follow the [Scaffolder spec](/authoring/scaffolder-spec).

**SemVer constraint** — version range syntax used in `extends` and `dependencies`. `^1.0.0` (caret), `~1.2.0` (tilde), `1.2.3` (exact), `>=1.2.0` (open-ended).

**Skill** — a user-invocable slash command (e.g. `/verify-system`). Shipped as a directory with `skill.md` at its root. Global skills live in `~/.claude/skills/`; team-scoped skills ship with a team and appear in `.claude/skills/` after install.

**Status** — a team's state in the registry: `verified`, `community`, or `deprecated`.

**Team** — a Git repository with `team.json` at its root, bundling agents, skills, and rules for a specific kind of work.

**team.json** — the manifest file at the root of every team repo. Declares name, version, description, what's bundled, what's extended, what's excluded.

**Workspace** — `agentteamland/workspace`, the maintainer hub repo where all peer repos are aggregated for development. Not needed to use AgentTeamLand; only relevant if you're contributing to the platform itself.

**Journal** — chronological per-agent learning record under `.claude/journal/{date}_{agent}.md`. Replaces the retired `agent-memory/` layer. Written by `/save-learnings`; read by Claude during agent startup per the [knowledge-system rule](https://github.com/agentteamland/core/blob/main/rules/knowledge-system.md).

**knowledge-base-summary** — required YAML frontmatter field on every `children/{topic}.md` (and `learnings/{topic}.md`) file. One- to three-line summary that `/save-learnings` extracts to rebuild the parent agent.md's Knowledge Base (or skill.md's Accumulated Learnings) section. Source-of-truth — hand edits to the rebuilt section are overwritten on the next save-learnings run.

**knowledge-system** — the core rule that defines the two-layer knowledge model (`journal/` + `wiki/`). Renamed from `memory-system` in `core@1.8.0` after the agent-memory layer was merged into journal.

**learnings/** — per-skill subdirectory mirroring agents' `children/`. Each `learnings/{topic}.md` carries `knowledge-base-summary` frontmatter; the skill's `## Accumulated Learnings` section is auto-rebuilt from those.

**Learning marker** — inline HTML comment dropped by Claude during a conversation when a learning moment occurs. Format: `<!-- learning topic: ... kind: ... doc-impact: ... body: ... -->`. Scanned by `atl learning-capture` on the next session's `SessionStart` and processed by `/save-learnings --from-markers`.

**Wiki** — topic-organized current-truth knowledge under `.claude/wiki/{topic}.md`. Replaced (not appended) when truth changes; the `<!-- wiki:index -->` marker block in CLAUDE.md keeps the live index visible to Claude on every session start.
