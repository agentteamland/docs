# Knowledge system

How knowledge is organized in an `atl`-using project. Two layers: **journal** (date-based historical record) and **wiki** (topic-based current truth). That's it. Two layers. Don't add more.

The canonical rule lives at [`core/rules/knowledge-system.md`](https://github.com/agentteamland/core/blob/main/rules/knowledge-system.md). This page is the user-facing summary.

(Renamed from `memory-system` in `core@1.8.0` to reflect the post-Q4 reality: there is no separate "memory" layer anymore. The two date-based layers — agent memory + journal — were merged into a single `journal/` layer in [self-updating-learning-loop](https://github.com/agentteamland/workspace/blob/main/.claude/docs/self-updating-learning-loop.md) Q4. The previous file name was misleading.)

## The two layers at a glance

| Layer | Location | Purpose | Update style |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Journal** | `.claude/journal/{YYYY-MM-DD}_{agent}.md` | Date-based historical record. Per-agent learning history AND inter-agent signals (the two layers were merged in Q4 — they were redundant in practice). | Append-only |
| **Wiki** | `.claude/wiki/{topic}.md` | Topic-based current truth. Reflects what is true NOW; old facts are replaced, not appended. | Replace / update |

Different paradigms, different purposes:

- **Journal answers** "what happened over time?" (chronological narrative)
- **Wiki answers** "what is true now?" (topic-based snapshot)

You can read either; they're not mutually exclusive. But they're written differently.

## Journal — append, never edit

Filename: `{YYYY-MM-DD}_{agent-name}.md`. Multiple agents on the same date → multiple files. Same agent multiple times in a day → all in one file with sub-headings.

What goes here:

- Date-stamped narrative of what happened: discoveries, decisions, bug fixes, what worked, what didn't
- Cross-agent notes ("for whoever touches X next: …")
- Auto-created artifact lists ("this session created wiki page Y, agent children file Z")
- User-approved structural changes (new skill / rule / agent decisions and rejections)

Rules:

- **Append-only.** Existing entries are not edited; new entries go at the end.
- **Idempotency:** when [`/save-learnings`](/skills/save-learnings) writes a journal bullet, it hashes `(kind + topic + body)` and skips duplicates already in this file or any same-date `.claude/journal/*.md`.
- **Never deleted** (historical record).
- **`*.local.md` filename pattern is gitignored** — use it for genuinely private content (uncommon).

The journal layer is what `.claude/agent-memory/` USED to be (per-agent history) PLUS what the original journal layer was (cross-agent signals). Q4 of self-updating-learning-loop merged them because in practice the two layers had identical format (date + agent + narrative) and frequently cited each other anyway.

## Wiki — replace, current truth only

Filename: `{topic}.md` (kebab-case, one concept per page).

The project's living knowledge base. Unlike journal (historical record), wiki reflects **current truth** — when a fact changes, the page is updated, not appended.

Rules:

- **Organized by topic, not by date** (one page per concept)
- **Updated from `<!-- learning -->` markers** via [`/save-learnings`](/skills/save-learnings), or directly via [`/wiki ingest`](/skills/wiki)
- **Pages reflect what is true NOW** — old info is replaced, not appended
- **Cross-referenced:** related pages link to each other
- **`index.md` auto-maintained** as table of contents
- **A `<!-- wiki:index -->` marker block** at the top of `CLAUDE.md` auto-aggregates the topic list (per [self-updating-learning-loop Q5](https://github.com/agentteamland/workspace/blob/main/.claude/docs/self-updating-learning-loop.md))
- **Bootstrap:** run [`/wiki init`](/skills/wiki) in a project without `.claude/wiki/` to scaffold it
- **Lint** with [`/wiki lint`](/skills/wiki) periodically

## Agent startup routine

At the start of every conversation, the agent reads (when applicable):

1. **Its own agent file** — from team, via project-local copy. The `agent.md` ships with a Knowledge Base section auto-aggregated from `children/*.md` frontmatter (per [Children + learnings](/guide/children-and-learnings)).
2. **`CLAUDE.md` `<!-- wiki:index -->` block** — auto-loaded; gives the knowledge map at zero cost. Agents discover relevant wiki pages from this list rather than scanning `.claude/wiki/` directly.
3. **Recent journal entries** when the task overlaps with prior work — `.claude/journal/` (last few entries are usually enough).
4. **Project-specific rules** at `.claude/docs/coding-standards/{app}.md` if present.

The agent does NOT read all wiki pages. It reads the index (auto-loaded), and only follows links to detail pages when the task touches that domain. This keeps context tight while preserving discoverability.

## End-of-conversation routine — auto-trigger via SessionStart

The "save at session end" semantic is implemented as **scan-on-next-session-start** because Claude Code's `SessionEnd` hook output never reaches the next-session Claude (per the [Learning marker lifecycle](/guide/learning-marker-lifecycle) page). The auto-trigger flow:

- **During conversation:** drop `<!-- learning -->` markers when learning moments occur. See the [marker lifecycle page](/guide/learning-marker-lifecycle) for marker format and discipline.
- **At next session start:** [`atl session-start`](/cli/setup-hooks) wrapper → [`atl learning-capture --previous-transcripts`](/cli/learning-capture) → output appears in additionalContext → you invoke [`/save-learnings --from-markers --transcripts ...`](/skills/save-learnings) → loop closes.
- **When a change is user-facing:** in the same turn the change is made, also update the matching README / docs-site page. See [`docs-sync` rule](https://github.com/agentteamland/core/blob/main/rules/docs-sync.md).

If `atl setup-hooks` is not installed, markers still accumulate in the transcript and remain available for manual `/save-learnings` invocation. The hook flow is the automation; the marker discipline + manual invocation is the foundation.

## Why two layers, not three

Earlier versions of this rule defined three layers: **memory** (per-project, per-agent, append-only history), **journal** (per-project, cross-agent signals, append-only), **wiki** (per-project, topic-based, replace/update).

The first two were both date-based, append-only, narrative-shaped. In every workspace they ended up cross-referencing each other or redundantly capturing the same events. The "agent's private memory vs. broadcast to others" distinction was never enforced — anyone could read either layer.

Q4 of self-updating-learning-loop merged them because:

- Same format → no semantic separation
- Same audience (all agents read both)
- Same write pattern (append by date)
- The split added cognitive overhead ("is this for me or for others?") without producing different content

The merged layer is just `journal/`. Wiki stays separate because its paradigm (topic-based current truth) is genuinely different from journal's (date-based history).

## Per-team / per-project mirrors

The same two-layer system applies inside the user's project (`.claude/journal/`, `.claude/wiki/`) AND on the team-repo side for cross-project knowledge:

- **Agent children files** (`children/{topic}.md` in the team repo's agent directory) are the team-side equivalent of wiki — topic-based, replace/update, cross-project domain knowledge for the agent.
- **Skill learnings files** (`learnings/{topic}.md` in the team repo's skill directory) are the per-skill equivalent — same shape, scoped to the skill.

Both have a `knowledge-base-summary:` frontmatter field that's auto-aggregated into `agent.md` (Knowledge Base section) or `skill.md` (Accumulated Learnings section). See [Children + learnings](/guide/children-and-learnings) for the full pattern.
